#Introduction
Think Like A Coder Too is a web project designed to help QA understand the mindset and processes used by developers. The intent is get the tester to think like a coder in order to aide in creating test cases and help with communicating the potential cause of a found defect, if needed.

This project uses common file names, techniques, and structures usually used in real web page applications.  One common file is this README.md file.

**README.md**
This file is a text file that introduces and explains projects.  It is used by new developers to get familiar with the project, set up all necessary tools, and begin either using the project/app or continue developing for it.  The ".md" extension denotes that is a "Mark Down" file. Mark Down files use the Mark Down language, which is a lightweight formatting language used to add formatting to plain text documents.
